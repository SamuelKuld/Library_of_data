<h1>Purpose</h1>
<p>
I have been wanting to make something like this for a bit just because I felt like having access to a lot of data and creating a reliable and adaptive data collection and interpretation software would be good.
</p>
<p>
I'm fairly unprofessional with my code writing skills. This comes mostly from a lack of experience in a work field.
</p>
<p>
I put in heavy efforts to optimize yet most of the time they're met with similar results as before I optimize.
</p>
<p>Anyway. I'm mostly just making this to make it and determine if there's any random correlations out there that are repeatable. I'm also planning to implement this into my website and create simple JSON requests so that people can use it as a nice data collector for certain things.
</p>
<p>
There are defeinitely things that I could make better, the only thing is that it will take a large amount of time to implement these things. So no matter if you are new to coding or if you would just like to contribute a little, feel free to just optimize small sections or add a completely new one. I'm not that skilled (Especially since no one has taught me how to) at scraping or crawling, so this would be a good learning experience.
But with full expectation for this to go nowhere, here's my first well thought out program.
